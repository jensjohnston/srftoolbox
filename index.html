      <div class="measure pb3-ns">
        Your team is a system. It is complex with multiple and interlocking parts. We like to borrow the term Operating System (OS) from the software industry, to denote a complex system that supports people to work (programmes to run) and is improved over time through constant, small iterations.
        This workshop is an essential starting point for any team that wants to update its OS and evolve the way it works. Most teams work and grow organically, with little deliberate attention given to designing the working process, exploring interpersonal relations, and challenging traditional notions of hierarchy.
        By taking the time to do a self-assessment a team can surface things that are implicit, and make them explicit. Only once they are explicit can a team talk about them and change them.

        This workshop uses 6 dimensions to frame the reflection and discussion. Write these on a whiteboard, flipchart paper, or show them on a screen for the team to copy.

        Give each team member a sheet of flipchart paper, portrait orientation. Instruct them to draw 5 horizontal lines, splitting it into 6 equal sections and label each section with a dimension.

        Now give them 30 minutes to reflect on these dimensions in silence. Individually, they should write down statements that apply to each dimension. These should all complete the sentence:

        On a whiteboard or flipchart draw a large version of the 6 sections that they have been working on. The aim of this step is to bring everyone's statements together to see where the team agrees and disagrees on the 6 dimensions.

        One-by-one, invite the team members to share 2-3 post-its from each dimension. They should just read out what they have written. No additional explanation or justification is necessary at this point.

        Give each team member a sheet of small coloured sticky dots. They should all be the same colour, so you can't tell who voted for which statement.

        Ask the team members to look at the clustered statements. They should stick a dot on the statements that they think are important to this team. The things they think should be addressed, changed, or celebrated. There is no limit to the amount of dots they can use.

        When everyone is finished voting, step back and look at the board / flipchart. The spread, density, and frequency of the dots will give you an immediate sense of what the team thinks is important.

        Ask the group for a volunteer to turn what is on the board / flipchart into a digital image. They should take a picture(s) on their phone, and transfer the information onto a collaborative, editable document. Something like a Google Document.
        
        Now is the time for a group discussion. The team should decide what to do with this information.

          Many meetings end with a “next steps” or “action items” discussion. These discussions are often abstract, starting with a list of tasks that are then handed out to possibly unwilling 
          participants with no particular deadline attached. By focusing the discussion on a Who/What/When matrix, you can connect people with clear actions on tasks and a commitment on when they will complete the task

            On a flip chart or whiteboard, create a matrix that outlines WHO | WHAT | WHEN.
            Although instincts may be to start with the “WHAT” (the tasks and items that need to be done), this approach starts with the “WHO” (the people who will be taking the actions). Put every participant’s name into the matrix in this column.

          Actions don’t take themselves, and people don’t commit as strongly to actions as they do to each other. By approaching next steps “people-first,” a few things change. First, it becomes clear that the people in the room are the ones who are accountable for next steps. Second, by making commitments in front of their peers, participants stake their credibility on taking action, and are more likely to follow through. And third, it becomes clear WHO is going to do WHAT by WHEN—and who has volunteered little or no commitment.

          In completing the Who|What|When matrix, you are likely to find that there is a lot to do. This is a good time to ask if there is any way for participants who have committed to little or nothing to step up their contribution. They may be able to assist others in completing their tasks—or their attendance may have been unnecessary.

      <div class="measure pb3-ns">
        A short activity to run early in a program, focused on sharing fears, anxieties and uncertainties related to the program theme. The purpose is to create openness within a group. The stinky fish is a metaphor for "that thing that you carry around but don’t like to talk about; but the longer you hide it, the stinkier it gets." By putting stinky fish (fears and anxieties) on the table, participants begin to relate to each other, become more comfortable sharing, and identify a clear area for development and learning.

        People spend hours sitting in training sessions, sifting through orientation manuals, and playing corporate e-learning games to learn the know-how for their new positions. But the reality is that the bulk of employee knowledge is gained through social experience. Campfire leverages our natural storytelling tendencies by giving participants a format and a space in which to share work stories—of trial and error, failure and success, competition, diplomacy, and teamwork. Campfire is useful not only because it acts as an informal training game, but also because it reveals commonalities (and diversity) in people's perception and experience. - This session can be revised to be used as a warmup, icebreaker, deepening session, anywhere storytelling could be useful to your group/team.

          Your role as the meeting leader is simply to encourage the sharing of work-related stories. If you find a lull in the storytelling thread, refer the employees back to the “wall of words” or ask someone to throw out a “wild card” story. You can also share work-related stories of your own that are triggered by stories from the players. You can let the stories drift toward less positive or neutral topics if you think the players need some catharsis, but be prepared to manage what may come up and don’t let the meeting conclude on a sour note

        The outcomes in your culture are the fruits. These are the things you want your culture to achieve, or what you want to “harvest” from your garden.
        The behaviours are the heart of your culture. They’re the positive or negative actions people perform everyday that will result in a good or bad harvest.
        The enablers and blockers are the elements that allow your garden to flourish or fail. For example, weeds, pests, bad weather, or lack of knowledge might be hindering your garden. Where as fertilizer, expertise in gardening specific crops, or good land might be helping your garden to grow.

        Dotmocracy is a simple method for group prioritization or decision-making.

Each person votes for the options they think are the strongest, and that information is used to inform a decision.

            By defining themes and insights, you’ve identified problem areas that pose challenges to the people you’re designing for. Now, try reframing your insight statements as How Might We questions to turn those challenges into opportunities for design. We use the How Might We format because it suggests that a solution is possible and because they offer you the chance to answer them in a variety of ways. A properly framed How Might We doesn’t suggest a particular solution, but gives you the perfect frame for innovative thinking.

            Start by looking at the insight /problem statements that you’ve created. Try rephrasing them as questions by adding “How might we” at the beginning.
            Translate your problem statement into a “How might we…” (HMW) question (i.e.: instead of “Our teams are too insular.” write: “How might we better connect our teams with one another?”).

          </div>
          <div class="f4-ns measure-narrow">
            Now take a look at your How Might We question and ask yourself if it allows for a variety of solutions. If it doesn’t, broaden it. Your How Might We should generate a number of possible answers and will become a launchpad for your Brainstorms.

            Finally, make sure that your How Might We’s aren’t too broad. It’s a tricky process but a good How Might We should give you both a narrow enough frame to let you know where to start your Brainstorm, but also enough breadth to give you room to explore wild ideas.

      Regular, effective feedback is one of the most important ingredients in building constructive relationships and thriving teams. 
      Openness creates trust and trust creates more openness. 
      Feedback exercises aim to support groups to build trust and openness and for individuals to gain self-awareness and insight. 
      Feedback exercises should always be conducted with thoughtfulness and high awareness of group dynamics. 
      This is an exercise for groups or teams that have worked together for some time and are familiar with giving and receiving feedback. 
      It uses the words “stop”, “start” and “continue” to guide the feedback messages.

The shaping of questions in a thoughtful, purposeful and intentional manner increases the likelihood of them being powerful. It’s a simple way for a team to open or close a process, symbolically and in a collaborative way. Checking-in/out invites each member in a group to be present, seen, and heard. Checking-in emphasizes presence, focus, and group commitment; checking-out emphasizes reflection and closure.

        Stand or sit in a circle. Invite each member of the group to share one thing they “check-out” with. This could be a feeling, a reflection, the most important thing they take with them, what stands out the most, etc. Choose a check-out question based on the group and the purpose of the session.
